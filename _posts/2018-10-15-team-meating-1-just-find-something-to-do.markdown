            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>As you may know from the blog <a href="{{ "/2018/10/12/team-what.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">post #2</a>, I had to take the decision of leaving my old team that was made out of students that I do not know on a topic that I did not like, and join my current team on detecting barcodes and extras.</p><br>
            <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="{{ "/assets/confused-math.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Gandalf iamge confused about teams"><br>
            <h4>You did what!?</h4>
            <p>What would you do if on your first meeting you find yourself listening to your teammates, Ben and Rob, telling you how they already got most of the barcode detection done and that the project might be easier than we thought?<br> For some people, I assume that this would be met with relief. However, in my case me, few concerns came up... I know for sure that our teacher, Jane, likes to see proper reasearch done and attention put into adding extra features where possible. That means that every memeber has to go an extra mile and contribute greatly to the team.</p>
            <p>I am sure the rest felt the same and, while still in shock, we decided to add a bit more complexity to our project.<br>With the already amazing progress made in such a short time and the ideas that we discussed in this meeting (explained in the next paragraph), this team was off to a great start!</p><br>
            <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="{{ "/assets/woah.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Image about abandoning the ship"><br>
            <p>So there goes the explaining how we got most of the barcode detection working and we are amazed by the progress. We quickly put on the table what is left to do and who takes on what. Since we are a team of three, we decided to add more complexity to our project by adding detection for QR codes too. Quickly to be followed up by decoding both barcodes and QR codes.<br>The work on the detection would fall on Rob since he had started his part already and he had an idea about the QR codes so he took over that too. Ben took over decoding the codes.<br>We quickly realised that there wasn't much for me to do since we were 3 people and only 2 tasks. While the other two tasks were big and difficult, the execution on them wasn't always perfect and they were dependent on the quality of the images added. That's when we decided that I would take over preparing the images for the detection and decoder. That means cleaning images, aligning them and making the important features stand out.</p>
            <p>At that we called it a day and went on for a week.</p>
